## About
Bank Management System is based on a concept to generate and maintain daily payment transactions with the customerâ€™s account. Before stepping into the main system a user has to pass through login system to get access, then only he/she can use all the features.

## Introduction

Banking is defined as the business activity of accepting and safeguarding money owned by other individuals and entities, and then lending out this money in order to conduct economic activities such as making profit or simply covering operating expenses. A bank is a financial institution which create a new account ,update information of existing account, maintain transactions, check the details of existing account, remove existing account, view customer's list, and then show ATM features.

Our motto is to develop a software program for managing the entire bank process related to Administration accounts customer accounts and to keep each every track about their property and their various transaction processes efficiently.
