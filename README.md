## About
The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project we tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks. Also to enable the user’s work space to have additional functionalities which are not provided under a conventional banking project. The Bank Account Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop software for Bank Account Management System. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which is not possible with the manuals systems, which are overcome by this software. The project is developed using C as a prgoramming language.

Bank Management System is based on a concept to generate and maintain daily payment transactions with the customer’s account. Before stepping into the main system a user has to pass through login system to get access, then only he/she can use all the features.
